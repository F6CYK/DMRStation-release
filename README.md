# DMRStation binaries

A free and open source DMR network radio by EA3IHI

## Installation

Download or clone this repository to your hardware.

You might need to add some packages to your distribution as for instance:

* pulseaudio
* libpulse-mainloop-glib0

Here you have some installation instructions when using the **STM32MP157C-DK2**:

```bash
echo "deb http://packages.openstlinux.st.com/1.2 thud main updates untested" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/packages.openstlinux.st.com.list
apt-get update
apt-get install -y --allow-unauthenticated libpulse-mainloop-glib0 jq
ln -s /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 /lib/ld-linux.so.3

mkdir /opt
cd /opt
wget https://github.com/ea3ihi/DMRStation-release/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv DMRStation-release-master DMRStation
cd DMRStation
chmod +x *.sh
chmod +x DMRstation

```

Now edit the configuration file and make sure to have a copy of the md380-emu in the same folder and it has execute permission.
If all is ready just type `./start.sh` press enter and some magic will happen.

You can add a shell script in the `/usr/local/weston-start-at-startup/` folder to run the application at startup.
Suggestion: add a `sleep 8` to let all the services and audio devices be ready.


**Instructions for the Raspberry Pi**

So here is my try at giving step by step instructions for the rpi:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libpulse-mainloop-glib0 jq at-spi2-core
sudo ln -s /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 /lib/ld-linux.so.3

sudo mkdir /opt
cd /opt
sudo wget https://github.com/ea3ihi/DMRStation-release/archive/master.zip
sudo unzip master.zip
sudo mv DMRStation-release-master DMRStation
cd DMRStation
sudo chmod a+x *.sh
sudo chmod a+x DMRstation
```

Now edit the configuration file DMRStation.ini with your favourite editor (use sudo as convenient)


Place a copy of md380-emu in the /opt/DMRStation folder and make sure it is executable by all users:
```
sudo chmod a+x /opt/DMRStation/md380-emu
```

Test if DMRStation runs:

```
DISPLAY=:0 ./start.sh
```

If it does it is a good time to add a "desktop" entry in your *./config/autostart folder*:


Edit the file DMRStation.desktop in *~/.config/autostart* with these contents:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=PulseAudio Sound System
Exec=/bin/sh -c "cd /opt/DMRStation;./start.sh"
Terminal=false
Type=Application
X-GNOME-Autostart-Phase=Initialization
NotShowIn=KDE;
```

## md380-emu

For now there is no support for Ammbe server so using the emulator is the only option.

You can get the emulator from source code from this repository:

https://github.com/DVSwitch/md380tools/tree/master/emulator

## Configuration

Edit `DMRStation.ini` to add your callsign, dmr id, repeater id and other values.

## TGs
You can also set your favourite tgs in the file `tgs.dat`.
A name starting with * means that it is not a TG but a private contact, so you can make private calls!

## DMR ids database

Run `DMRIDSUpdate.sh` to download and update the list of DMR Ids.


## Running DMRStation

Run `start.sh`. You might need to set up your DISPLAY environment variable first: `DISPLAY=:0 start.sh`
